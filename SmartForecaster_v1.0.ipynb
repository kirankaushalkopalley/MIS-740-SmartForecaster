    "### Product Information:\n",
    "In the Hospitality Industry the planning of labor is vital. Fulfilling the business needs during high and low times becomes complicated and might vary depending on the particular department. The front office operations strongly depend on scheduling procedures and smart staffing. This includes not only “covering the desk” at all times, but also being efficient, strategic and analytical when it comes to labor costs estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept of “Smart Forecaster” application is based on the check in amount of guests in the particular date range in the last few years. The application will forecast, according to the historical information, and advise management staff about the amount of workers they will need to schedule at any given time of the day.\n",
